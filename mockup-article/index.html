<h1><strong>Human vs. Machines An Al Odyssey</strong></h1>
<h4>By <strong><i>Christopher Watkins</i></strong></h4>
<h5>March 10,2016</h5>

<article><strong><i>***Breaking News: AlphaGo has won the first two matches!***</strong>In this, the third in our series
    on the epic Go matches bring played between AlphaGo (Google Artifical Intelligance Software) and Lee Se-Dol (Current
    World Champion), we look at the histroy of Humans vs.Machines, and the innovation that have led us to this
    incredible moment in time.</i></article>

<article>For as long as human have built things, we've wrestled with the implications of what we've built.In many cases,
    these philosophical and ethical wrestlings have made for great drama&#8212 think Frankenstein or 2001: A Space
    Odyssey.
    Often, the hypothetical scenarious we envision come remarkably close to true, and the discoveries we've made in the
    fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning make clear that a "computer with a mind of its own"<del>is
        going to take over the world</del> not
    sub such a fantastic thing to imagine any longer</article>

<strong>
    <h2>The Triump Of Deep Blue</h2>
</strong>

<p>Perhaps this is why we are so captivated by human vs.machine competitions, because the idea of being overcome by
    that which we've created speaks to something very deep within our collective consciousness. When IBM's Deep Blue
    faced off against Garry Kasparov, the event resulted in more than <a href="#">three billion impressions</a>
    classaround the world,
    and
    when IBM's later creation Watson challenged the champions on Jeopardy, millions of viewers were glued to the
    proceedings.</p>

<h2><strong>DeepMind's AlphaGo</strong></h2>

<p>Taking place right now, there is an event that, while not likely to scale the same media heights, may in fact have
    far greater implications when it comes to the future of "intelligent" machines. On March 9, in Seoul, South Korea, a
    computing system know as AlphoGo (built by researchers at DeepMind-a Google Artificial Intelligence lab) began
    <a href="#">a five-game match</a>against Lee Se-dol, one of the very best players in the world at the ancient game of Go
</p>

<p>Why is this so significant?</p>

<p>Here is how thc DeepMind team explained it in their paper <a href="#">Mastering the Game of Go with Deep Neural Networks and
    Tree Search:</a></p>

<p><i>The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence due to
        its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves.</i></p>

<p>Put another way, winning at Go is a kind of Holy Grail for those who strive to create machines that can "think" on
    their own, because success at this uniquely complex game seems to require something more than just skill, knowledge,
    and experience. It requires intuition. Feel. Style. Characteristics we associate with humans, not with machines.
